10. Search Function for the Speaker's Bureau Program

Add a function to Programming challenge 9 that allows the user to search for a speaker on a
particular topic. It should accept a key word as an argument and then search the array for a
structure with that key word in the Speaking Topic Field. All structures that match should be
displayed. If no structure matches, a message saying so should be displayed.
